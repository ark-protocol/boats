Basis of Ark Technology
=====


The [Ark protocol](https://ark-protocol.org) is a layer-two protocol for
bitcoin.
Since it is a client-server protocol, each Ark implementation can specify its
own protocol for client-server interactions and even have their own encodings
for data structures.
Hence, there is little need for specifications to be maintained between
different implementations.

However, there are some aspects that might merit some coordination and
specification efforts between implementations. That is what this repository is
for.
