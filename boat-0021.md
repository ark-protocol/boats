BOAT #21: BIP-21 URI fields for Ark
=====

[BIP-21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki)
and [BIP-321](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0321.mediawiki)
describe a generic URI scheme for bitcoin: the `bitcoin:` scheme.
The specification of this URI has provisions for the definition of additional
fields used for specific protocols to communicate protocol-specific information.

This BOAT aims to list and describe such additional fields that are used for
the Ark protocol.


# Known fields

## `ark=` field

The `ark=` field can be used to add an Ark address as specified in
[BOAT-1](boat-0001.md). Since BOAT-1 addresses can have different purposes
based on the version number used, this is a generic URI field and the exact
purpose or capability is dependent on what version of BOAT-1 address is used.

For the `0` version of BOAT-1 addresses, this field will contain both an Ark ID
and a user public key that can be used to deliver payments within the Ark.

Example:
```
bitcoin:?ark=ark1qwh9vsmcz7nsh79xc02mta4r0pdqjss5d85qu6kfpvxe8x7zw8z6syujx93rqu9qmu5
```


# Case-sensitivity and QR encoding

All the above fields are case-insensitive, meaning that they can freely be
uppercased to leverage the more concise alphanumeric QR encoding.
